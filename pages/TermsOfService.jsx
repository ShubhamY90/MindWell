          Additionally, our design employs a blue-to-purple gradient, which according to <a className="text-purple-600 underline" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01274/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this research</a>, may help induce calmness and reduce emotional distress.
